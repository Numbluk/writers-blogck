title: Always Trying To Fill The Gap
---

Money does not motivate me, but I'm a little crazy about my time.
Throughout my short working life of almost seven years, I have optimised my life's time.
In the beginning, it was at the expense of my health: microwave meal after microwave meal to save time from cooking.
I lived close to work, so my commute was only around half an hour.
In the end, I had more time than I knew what to do with--more time than I'll likely ever have again.

Just what did I do with that, you ask?
A lot of it was spent on wondering what I should be doing with that time.
I went through a few programming books, a few hobby projects, read a lot, and even consistently worked out (but I gave that up in the end).
