title: When Is My Right Mind?
---

Most days I go my local cafe close to the waterfront in rural England.
I know the owners by name and most days they serve me a double espresso without asking.
There was a time where I used to walk in and ask for that double espresso.
It took a few weeks of getting the same thing over and over for them to assume that my decision would be the same the next day.

It may seem simple, but I truly struggle with variety and it's a reason I'm a creature of habit.
Fewer, yet better decisions.

It was the late afternoon on a hot Autumn day in 2021 in a Texas A&M University computer lab and it was the first time I had listened to _Hallelujah_ by Leonard Cohen.
Over the next three days, I must have listened to that song on repeat over a hundred times, but in that very moment it was like I couldn't function.
Each word more than each chord struck my mind like hot ice; a Jewish atheist writing better religious songs than any in the previous fifty.
I'm a cryer, or at least someone who isn't afraid to cry (moreso in private), although I'm not so brave as to openly cry in public.

The next few days were threw me out of my normal university life.
It was hard to think, feelings came and went, but the song kept calling.
I even struggled to focus on class because a large part of me felt off.

...

I listened to this song now and it's still just as good and it still puts me in a mood and captures something in me that wants to break out.

- Which decisions are easy to make and why is it so hard to make some decisions? (caring vs not caring)
- A seemingly simple decision
- A song which causes off balance
- Here's an easy one: What about when I'm drinking or I'm high? (to be clear: I do not drink and I do not smoke, I only mention it because these are common enough behaviours and it should be overtly obvious that both of them alter your "stable self" to the point that you want to avoid making any sort of serious indication while under the influence of both.)
- What about when I'm hungry?
- What about when I'm tired?
- What about when I'm stressed?
- There are so many things that can go wrong!
- How do you make decisions at all if something is wrong?
- What happens if something is wrong?
- Is it an average?
- The whole reason I'm writing this is because of one thing: you should take note of how you're feeling to notice when these things happen because they are unique to everyone.
- And you don't want to go making huge, shoot-from-hip life choices if you're not in a good state of mind.
- It doesn't stop you from making the right decisions, but it might help you avoid making stupid ones.
- There are so many things in life that can disrupt the tranquility of consistency.
- It's easier to make smaller decisions, but what about big ones?
- I can't
