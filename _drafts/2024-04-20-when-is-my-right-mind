title: When Is My Right Mind?
---

It was the late afternoon on a hot Autumn day in 2021 in a Texas A&M University computer lab and it was the first time I had listened to _Hallelujah_ by Leonard Cohen.
Over the next three days, I must have listened to that song on repeat over a hundred times, but in that very moment it was like I couldn't function.
Each word more than each chord struck my mind like hot ice; a Jewish atheist writing better religious songs than any in the previous fifty.
I'm a cryer, or at least someone who isn't afraid to cry (moreso in private), although I'm not so brave as to openly cry in public.

The next few days were threw me out of my normal university life.

...

I listened to this song now and it's still just as good and it still puts me in a mood and captures something in me that wants to break out.
