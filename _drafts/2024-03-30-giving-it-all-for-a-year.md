title: Giving It All For A Year
---

This isn't about New Years Resolutions, but about habits.
After all, anything you do for a year is surely a habit.
Every year during the Christmas season, I poke and prod friends and family about their New Years Resolutions.
This is something I started doing around 2016 because I was curious about what people considered important enough to not only dwell on, but what they considered important enough to improve or change.
So after Christmas Day, I became that person who would constantly pester people about their New Years Resolutions.
And funny enough, the results were more interesting than I thought they'd be.
Many family members who hadn't given it much thought ended up with two or three resolutions for the coming year.
I think peer pressure had something to do with it, but I'd like to think that they had simply never been forced to think about the question in any seriousness; a commercial trying to sell you something to prepare for New Years Resolutions is far different than someone leveling you with the same question.

Maybe you're someone who thinks New Years Resolutions are Capitalistic rubbish fabricated by gyms and corporations to create yet another event in the year to buy more stuff.
There's truth in its bastardisation, but I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I think you shouldn't either.

For _actual_ millenia, the West has treated the New Year as a time for renewal and I adhere to that.
Whether or not you're a holiday person (these people do exist), everyone tends to take time off towards the end of the year and the beginning of the next.
Historically, this time period has meant a lot of downtime away from work and time to think about the larger and more important things in life.
In my opinion, this is the exact reason why some struggle during the Christmas season: it's not just seeing family or being alone if you have none, but a period of downtime forced on you by national holidays, and in our connected modern lives we struggle to cope with this jolted disconnection from all the busyness of life like a prisoner guided through the steely corridors of a jail to the only place he has to go: his cell.

On the other hand, this time is exactly why I am a firm believer in New Years Resolutions.
What better way to spend time you're almost always going to take?
Don't wait for a sabbatical or long holiday to think about your life, do it every year.

I wish New Years Resolutions weren't perceived as one-time events because at the end of the day they are habits.
We _resolve_ to take up new a behaviour to undo or settle a part of ourselves which isn't quite how we want it to be.

It might be easy for you to think about the number of resolutions you've adhered to and I suspect for most people the answer is close to zero.
Why?
Because it's hard.
I'm patient zero for just how hard it is.

Every year, I methodically write down my resolutions for the year.
I categorise them into separate areas of my life such as physical, mental, spiritual, financial, etc. and I even stay consistent with some of them.
For example, this year I wanted to run, but with the only goal being able to run.
I've had knee pain for the past 11 years which has made running seem like a mountain, so all I wanted to do was run without pain in order to play with my children at a speed faster than a walk.
With some research and consistency, I'm proud to say I've accomplished that.

But I also wanted to lose weight this year.
And not only did I want to lose weight, but a very specific weight.
All in all, I wanted to drop from around 175lbs to 150lbs.
Guess how many times I've tried to lose enough weight to reach 150lbs?
At least five years.
I think that makes me a failure of sorts, or at least my plan isn't working.
One thing that usually ends up happening is I'll lose around half the weight and then gain it back again, so this year I'm taking a different approach: I'm taking a long term view of both losing and maintaining that weight loss.

By trying to lose weight and maintain the weight loss, I shift my strategy from a sprint to a marathon.
If I sprint too hard, I'll lose steam, be miserable, and arrive right back where I started.
By focusing on the end of the year, I can lose weight, pause, lose weight, pause, and rinse and repeat.
By focusing on the marathon, it becomes a habit rather than a one-time affair.

I'll report every month or so to say how I'm doing.

Interestingly, this long-term approach has spread to other habits as well.
For starters, I've picked up Lisp, I've been investigating starting a business, and I've picked up other exercise habits.
The killer motive is that I'm focused on the long-term which allows me to not be so crushed if I miss a day or two.
Life gets in the way, and I don't want it to; I want to enjoy it as it greets me.
By extending my goals to be realistic, I can remove the anxiety while making consistent progress in several areas of my life at once.
Before, I'd spend so much willpower on one area that it was impossible to improve myself in others.
In retrospect, it's obvious, but the forest is sometimes hard to see.
