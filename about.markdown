<h3 id="about-subtitle">Hi, my name is Lukas.</h3>

<hr class="diamond">

I work as a software engineering manager, but that's just my job. There are lots of other things in this world that interest me, so I try not to let my title tie me up too much.

This site has a simple layout: scroll back in time to see older posts. At the moment, there is no search function.
