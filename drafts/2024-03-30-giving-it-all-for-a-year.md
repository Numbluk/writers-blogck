title: Giving It All For A Year
---

This isn't about New Years Resolutions, but about habits.
After all, anything you do for a year is surely a habit.
Every year during the Christmas season, I poke and prod people about their New Years Resolutions.
This is something I started doing around 2016 because I was curious about what people considered important enough to not only dwell on, but what they considered important enough to improve or change.
So after Christmas Day, I became that person who would constantly pester his family members about their New Years Resolutions.
And funny enough, it worked.
Many family members who hadn't given it much thought ended up with two or three resolutions for the coming year.

What about me?

Maybe you're someone who thinks New Years Resolutions are Capitalistic-rubbish fabricated by gyms and corporations to create yet another event in the year to buy more stuff.
There's truth in its bastardisation, but I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I think you shouldn't either.

For _actual_ millenia, the West has treated the New Year as a time for renewal and I adhere to that.
Whether or not you're a holiday person (these people do exist), everyone tends to take time off towards the end of the year and the beginning of the next.
Historically, this time period has meant a lot of downtime away from work and time to think about the larger and more important things in life.
In my opinion, this is the exact reason why some struggle during the Christmas season: it's not just seeing family or being alone if you have none, but a period of downtime forced on you by national holidays, and in our connected modern lives we struggle to cope with this jolted disconnection which guides all of our thoughts like a prisoner guided through the steely corridors of a jail to the only place he has to go: his cell.
I also suspect that frustration with New Years Resolutions is that so few people keep them.??

On the other hand, this time is exactly why I am a firm believer in New Years Resolutions.
What better way to spend time you're almost always going to take?
Don't wait for a sabbatical or long holiday to think about your life, do it every year.

Now, what about me?
I wish New Years Resolutions weren't perceived as one-time events because at the end of the day they are habits.
We _resolve_ to take up new a behaviour to undo or settle a part of ourselves which isn't quite how we want it to be.

I want to talk about how difficult this is.
It might be easy for you to think about the number of resolutions you've adhered to.
I suspect for most people the answer is close to zero.
And why?

It's hard.
My approach.
How many have I kept?
I've had resolutions I've kept but started them mid-year.
It's better to think about habits.
